*Larry's Llama Learning Adventure*      
===========

**Built for Zappo's Summer 2015 Interview**              
      
*Deployed to Heroku at: http://llama-adventure-zappos.herokuapp.com/#/ [LINK IS ABOVE]*     
       
This is a very short choose your own adventure game with two possible results:          
               
1- Help Larry by taking his quick llama quiz. Are you a true llama?          
2- Head to the study guide to brush up on your llama knowledge before helping Larry.         
===========         
This application runs on AngularJS and is deployed in Heroku with a simple NodeJS server.       
The structure is built using HTML5 and CSS3.     
===========       
I went for a very minimalistic design so as not to distract from the actual adventure.      
           
The site should scale to all major devices including iPhone, most Android phones, iPad, most Android tablets, and Kindle.
